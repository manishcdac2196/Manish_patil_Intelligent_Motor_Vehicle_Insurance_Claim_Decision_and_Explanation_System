It is however, clarified that the entitlement of No Claim Bonus will be applicable for the substituted vehicle subject to the provision that the substituted vehicle on which the entitled NCB is to be applied is of the same class (as per this tariff) as the vehicle on which the NCB has been earned. Provided that where the insured is an individual, and on his/ her death the custody and use of the vehicle pass to his/her spouse and/or children and/or parents, the NCB entitlement of the original insured will pass on to such person/s to whom the custody and use of the vehicle pass. c) The percentage of NCB earned on a vehicle owned by an institution during the period when it was allotted to and exclusively operated by an employee should be passed on to the employee if the ownership of the vehicle is transferred in the name of the employee. This will however require submission of a suitable letter from the employer confirming that prior to transfer of ownership of the vehicle to the employee, it was allotted to and exclusively operated by the employee during the period in which the NCB was earned. d) In the event of the insured, transferring his insurance from one insurer to another insurer, the transferee insurer may allow the same rate of NCB which the insured would have received from the previous insurer. Evidence of the insured’s NCB entitlement either in the form of a renewal notice or a letter confirming the NCB entitlement from the previous insurer will be required for this purpose. Where the insured is unable to produce such evidence of NCB entitlement from the previous insurer, the claimed NCB may be permitted after obtaining from the insured a declaration as per the following wording: “I / We declare that the rate of NCB claimed by me/us is correct and that no claim as arisen in the expiring policy period (copy of the policy enclosed).

Failure of the insurer granting the NCB to write to the previous insurer within 21 days after granting the cover will also constitute a breach of the Tariff. e) If an insured vehicle is sold and not replaced immediately, or laid up, and the policy is not renewed immediately after expiry, NCB, if any, may be granted on a subsequent insurance, provided such fresh insurance is effected within 3 (three) years from the expiry of the previous insurance.
